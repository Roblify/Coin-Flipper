# Coin Flipper
This is a simple HTML-based coin flipper that allows users to click a button to flip a virtual coin and see the result.

## How it works
The Coin Flipper is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a single HTML file and a CSS file for styling.

When the user opens the HTML file in a web browser, they will see a button labeled "Flip Coin." When they click the button, a JavaScript function is triggered to simulate the flipping of a coin.

The JavaScript function generates a random number, either 0 or 1, representing the two possible outcomes of a coin flip (heads or tails). Based on the result, the function updates the HTML content to display either an image of a heads or tails.
